    "# Data Preparation Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will extract all the data we need to run both the uncalibrated SWIM-RS model and to calibrate and run a parameterized model. The model uses a daily soil water balance, and as such, it needs a daily estimate of meteorological drivers and some *a priori* information on the soils in our sample locations. It also needs an estimate of the state of the vegetation on the surface, for which we use Landsat-based NDVI. With this information, we will be able to run SWIM-RS to estimate the daily ET, soil water storage, recharge, runoff, and simulated irrigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calibrate the model so it behaves more realistically, we must use the parameter inversion software (PEST++, in this case) alongside target data which provides *somewhat* independent estimates of ET and snow on the ground. Once the model is calibrated for a sample plot, these data are no longer needed. Therefore, the calibrated model can be run for periods before or after SNODAS or ETf data is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remote sensing data (ETf and NDVI) are the most time-consuming step, as the data are being extracted from potentially thousands of separate Landsat-like images in Earth Engine. The snow, soils, and irrigation data, on the other hand, are relatively quick, as the images are fewer, with one CONUS-wide image per day in SNODAS, a few static images for the soils data, and one image annually for the irrigation products. However, thanks to Earth Engine, even the Landsat-based products are quickly extracted if the number of sample plots are small and clustered in space, as they are for this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SWIM-RS approach requires the following input datasets to run and/or calibrate:\n",
    "1. NDVI: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index is a measure made using the red and near-infrared bands of a multispectral instrument. It is a good way to estimate the relative density and vigor of vegetation, which is highly correlated with transpiration. NDVI is used as a proxy for the transpirative component of the crop coefficient in SWIM-RS, Kcb. Here, we access NDVI information from Landsat satellite images in Earth Engine.\n",
    "2. ETf: The rate of ET expressed as a fraction of reference/potential ET. This is also known in agricultural water use modeling as the 'crop coefficient', or Kc. For this tutorial we use SSEBop, accessed from Google Earth Engine. We could use results from any number of remote sensing-based modeling approaches (METRIC, OpenET ensemble, etc.). *FOR USE IN CALIBRATION ONLY*\n",
    "3. Soils: We need an initial estimate of soil hydraulic properties that govern the way water behaves in our very simple model soil water reservoir.\n",
    "4. Irrigation: We use an irrigation mask (IrrMapper or LANID) to constrain the data extraction of the irrigated and unirrigated portions of any given sample plot.\n",
    "5. Snow: We use the SNODAS product to estimate the snow water equivalent (SWE) at a daily time step to calibrate the simple snow model in SWIM-RS. *FOR USE IN CALIBRATION ONLY*\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: For this tutorial, we use 'field' and 'plot' somewhat interchangeably. Indeed, the sample plots for this tutorial are fields. However, we could draw an arbitraty polygon over a location of interest and run the model there. Keep in mind, the data will represent the mean of the irrigated and unirrigated portions of the sample plot. Therefore, using sensible land-use features (e.g., individual agricultrual fields) is a good approach because assuming homogenous land-use managment in a single field is not a terrible assumption. \n",

    "# Earth Engine Asset Upload and Remote Sensing Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will:\n",
    "1. Upload our data as an Earth Engine asset.\n",
    "2. Use the `clustered_sample_etf` function to perform SSEBop ETf extraction.\n",
    "3. Use the `clustered_sample_ndvi` function to perform SSEBop NDVI extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure that the Earth Engine Python API is authenticated and configured, and that the Earth Engine CLI is available in your environment."
